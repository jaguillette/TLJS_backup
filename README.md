This is a repo that I am using as a backup in case there is an issue with the main [TimelineJS site](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) hosting timelines.

This utilizes code from the [main Timeline JS repository](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS3) and is set up based on [documentation for hosting a custom timeline](https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/instantiate-a-timeline.html)

The timeline expects an `id` GET parameter to be set to the identifier for a Google Sheet set up for use in a timeline.
